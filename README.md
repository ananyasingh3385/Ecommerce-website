An e-commerce website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript provides a platform for users to browse products, add them to a cart, and complete purchases. HTML is used to structure the website, including pages like the homepage, product listings, cart, and checkout. CSS enhances the visual appeal and responsiveness of the site, ensuring a smooth user experience across different devices. JavaScript adds interactivity, enabling features such as dynamic cart updates, product filtering, and real-time price calculations. Additionally, local storage can be used to save cart items, allowing users to revisit their selections later. For a fully functional store, a payment gateway can be integrated to handle secure transactions. This type of website serves as a foundation for online businesses, providing a seamless shopping experience for customers.
